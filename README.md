Splash Screen & Get Started Button:

First, create a splash screen with a "Get Started" button that leads to the main app.

Bottom Tab Navigation:
Implement bottom tab navigation using React Navigation, which will contain three screens: Home Screen, Search Screen, and Forecast Screen.

Home Screen:
On the Home Screen, display the user's current location fetched from an API.
Show the current weather report based on the time of day at the bottom of the screen.

Search Screen:
On the Search Screen, integrate a third-party weather API to allow users to search for live weather data by city name or postal code.
Add a location icon that, when pressed, fetches the user's current location, but the functionality is not yet fully implemented.

Forecast Screen:
On the Forecast Screen, display the weather history for today as well as forecast data for the upcoming days.
